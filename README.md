# Aseprite RGB555 Picker

A custom dialog script for picking colors for 15-bit high color systems in
Aseprite, like the Super Famicom and the Game Boy Color.

## Features

- Pick values from 0 to 31 for the R, G and B color channels with number entries
  and with the custom-made 5-bit sliders.
- Snaps Aseprite's current foreground color to its 15-bit counterpart anytime
  it changes through any mean (built-in RGB/HSV/HSL picker, eye dropper,
  palette...) while the dialog is open.
