# Aseprite RGB555 Picker

A custom dialog script for picking colors for 15-bit high color systems, like the Super Famicom (SNES) and the Game Boy Color.

## Features

- **Custom 5-bit sliders**

  They work like the built-in RGB sliders in the color picker,
  but they were adapted for 5-bit values.

  Change values by clicking, dragging, scrolling the mouse wheel or
  pressing the arrow keys while the middle or right mouse button is held down.

- **Live quantization of foreground color**

  Keep the RGB555 Picker open, and whenever you pick a new foreground color
  through any means (built-in RGB/HSV/HSL picker, eye dropper, palette...),
  it gets quantized to one of RGB555's colors.

  Use this to experiment with how your colors get quantized to RGB555 or to
  quickly convert some colors in your sprite.
